# Jagua-rs üêÜ

This crate contains everything necessary to solve 2D irregular cutting and packing problems without the combinatorial decision-making (i.e. which items to place where).

It provides all necessary entities and components to create a dynamic model of a 2D irregular C&P instance and provide a collision detection engine to check the feasibility of a placement.

`jagua-rs` is not a standalone algorithm, but rather is designed to be used as a building block by optimization algorithms which employ `jagua-rs` to provide efficient collision detection.
This optimization algorithm would tackle combinatorial challenge, while `jagua-rs` would handle the geometric challenge.

See [lbf crate](../lbf) for a reference implementation of an optimization algorithm making use of `jagua-rs`.

## Design Goals

- **General purpose** 
  - [x] Bin- and strip-packing problems
  - [x] Irregular shaped items and bins
  - [x] Continuous rotation and translation of items
  - [x] Support for holes and quality zones in the bin
- **Robust**
  - [x] Performs collision detection using the polygonal representation of shapes
  - [x] Mimics the results of a naive trigonometric approach, but much faster
  - [x] Avoids infeasibility due floating-point arithmetic errors by erring on the side of caution in edge cases
- **Adaptable**
  - [x] Define new C&P problem variants by adding custom `Instance` and accompanying `Problem` implementations.
  - [x] Unifying *spatial* constraints as `Hazards` allows for easy extension of the engine to incorporate extra constraints.
  - [x] `HazardFilters` enable specific `Hazards` to be *invisible* for specific collision checks.
- **Performant**
  - [x] Focus on maximum `query` and `update` performance
  - [x] Able to resolve millions of collision queries per second
  - [x] Custom polygon simplification procedures in preprocessing

## Documentation

The codebase is documented throughout using [rustdoc](https://doc.rust-lang.org/rustdoc/what-is-rustdoc.html).
Use `cargo doc --open` to compile and view the documentation in your browser.

## Testing

`jagua-rs` contains a suite of assertions which are enabled by default in debug builds to ensure the correctness of the engine.
These tests are sprinkled throughout the codebase and aim to check correctness of many of the datastructures.
In release builds, these assertions are disabled by default to maximize performance.

`lbf` contains some basic integration tests (with assertions enabled) to validate the correctness of the engine on a macro level.
See [lbf crate](../lbf#Testing) for more information.
