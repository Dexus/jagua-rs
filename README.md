## Introduction
2D irregular cutting and packing (C&P) problems are a class of optimization problems that involve placing irregular shaped items into containers in an efficient way.
These problems typically contain two challenges:
 * **Combinatorial** challenge: deciding which items to place where to minimize some objective function.
 * **Geometric** challenge: can we place an item at a certain position without colliding with other items? (feasibility check)

`Jagua-rs` aims to decouple these two challenges by developing a Collision Detection Engine (CDE) that can be used to efficiently deal with the geometric challenges at hand.


## Contents

### Jaguars
The `jaguars` crate contains all required logic for representing 2D irregular C&P problems and also contains the collision detection engine.

**See [jaguars](jaguars) for more information.**

## LBF
The `lbf` crate contains a reference implementation of an optimization algorithm using `jaguars`. \
It is a simple left-bottom-fill heuristic, which places the items one-by-one in the bin each time at the left-bottom most position.
It should provide a good starting point for anyone looking to create a more advanced optimization algorithm using ``jaguars``.

**See [lbf](lbf) for more information.**
